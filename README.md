I completed the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). 

I would like to thank the Rust community members who contributed to the book.

This repo contains my "tiny" additions to the webserver project in [Chapter 20](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).
